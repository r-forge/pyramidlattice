Description: `Giza' offers a simple way of creating multiple pyramid
        plots in one graphics window, exploiting the power of the
        lattice package. It is a handy way of visualizing longitudinal
        grouped (i.e.: age- and education-structured) data.
Depends: R (>= 2.11.0), lattice
Imports: reshape
