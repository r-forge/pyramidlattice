Title: Constructing panels of population pyramid plots based on lattice
Author: Erich Striessnig
Maintainer: Erich Striessnig <erich.striessnig@wu.ac.at>
Description: `Giza' offers a simple way of creating multiple pyramid
        plots in one graphics window, exploiting the power of the
        lattice package. It is a handy way of visualizing longitudinal
        grouped (i.e.: age- and education-structured) data.
Depends: R (>= 2.10.0), lattice, reshape
Imports: lattice (>= 0.18-1), grid
